/*
 * emit_usm_exe.c — build-time tool that writes the stock USM.exe from
 * the rawData[] byte array embedded in USM.c.
 *
 * USM.c (uploaded, 36.5 MB of ASCII-hex) declares:
 *   unsigned char rawData[5926912] = { 0x4D, 0x5A, ... };
 * which is byte-for-byte identical to the original Ultimate
 * Spider-Man USM.exe (5,926,912 bytes = 5.65 MiB).
 *
 * CMake compiles this file together with USM.c into a host-native
 * executable and runs it once during build with the target output
 * path as argv[1]. The result is <build>/USM.exe containing exactly
 * the same bytes as the stock game exe.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     emit_usm_exe <output-path>
 *
 * Example:
 *     emit_usm_exe build/USM.exe
